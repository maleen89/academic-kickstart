Hi, I'm Maleen. I am interested in novel software/hardware techniques to accelerate computationally challenging applications. I build C++ simulators to validate architectural ideas, write RTL to estimate complexity, and build FPGA solutions to accelerate real-world applications.

At MIT, I work with [Daniel Sanchez](http://people.csail.mit.edu/sanchez/) on the [Swarm](http://swarm.csail.mit.edu/) project, where we investigate how to use speculative execution to accelerate certain hard-to-parallelize applications such as [shortest path computations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) and [discrete event simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-event_simulation). My most recent project, [Chronos](https://github.com/SwarmArch/chronos), shows that these ideas can be used to build FPGA accelerators that runs 5x faster than 40-threaded CPUs.

Before starting grad school, I did my undergrad at University or Moratuwa in Sri Lanka. For my thesis, I was part of a 4-person team that designed and built an FPGA accelerator for HEVC/H.265 video decoding. This work led to the founding of [Paraqum Technologies](https://paraqum.com/), which provides FPGA-based acceleration solutions to clients in the Asia-Pacific region.

In addition, I did consulting work for [Wave computing](https://wavecomp.ai/), helping write new benchmarks to validate their CGRA architecture, and I have also interned at Microsoft Research's Brainwave project, a deep-learning accelerator for FPGAs.

I am looking to graduate in summer 2021, and is looking for full-time industry roles.
