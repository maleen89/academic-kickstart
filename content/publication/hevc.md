title: "4K Real-Time HEVC Decoder on an FPGA"
subtitle: ""
summary: "This work presents an FPGA-based harware implementation of a real-time 4K 30 fps HEVC decoder. Achieving such high perfromance on a low 150 MHz frequency required many architectural novelties, such as exploitation of the sparsity of transformed coefficient matrix, a single-cycle reference pixel processing in intra prediction, and flexible 8 Ã— 8 block ordering in DBF/SAO"
