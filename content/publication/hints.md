title: "Data-Centric Execution of Speculative Parallel Programs"
subtitle: ""
summary: "This work presents *spatial hints*, a technique that leverages program knowledge to reveal and exploit locality in speculative parallel
programs. We show it is easy to modify programs to convey locality through hints. We design simple hardware techniques that allow a state-of-the-art, tiled speculative architecture to exploit hints. Hints make speculative parallelism practical on large-scale systems: at 256 cores, hints achieve nearlinear scalability on nine challenging applications, improving
performance over hint-oblivious scheduling by 3.3× gmean and
by up to 16×"
